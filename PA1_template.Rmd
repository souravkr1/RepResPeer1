This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
activity <- read.csv("C:/Users/Sourav/Desktop/Data Science/Reproducible Research/activity.csv", colClasses = c("numeric", "character", 
                                                    "numeric"))

head(activity)

names(activity)
library(lattice)
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
StepsTotal <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = activity, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
hist(StepsTotal$steps, main = "Total steps by day", xlab = "day", col = "red")
mean(StepsTotal$steps)
median(StepsTotal$steps)

steps <- rep(NA, 61)
day <- rep("NA", 61)
stepsday <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$date, sum, na.rm = T)
length(stepsday)

for (i in 1:61) {
  steps[i] <- stepsday[[i]]
  day[i] <- names(stepsday)[i]
}
df <- data.frame(day, steps)
head(df)
hist(df$steps, main = "Total steps by day", xlab = "day", col = "green")

time_series <- tapply(activity$steps, activity$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
plot(row.names(time_series), time_series, type = "l", xlab = "5-min interval", 
     ylab = "Average across all Days", main = "Average number of steps taken", 
     col = "red")

max_interval <- which.max(time_series)
names(max_interval)

activity_NA <- sum(is.na(activity))
activity_NA

StepsAverage <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = activity, FUN = mean)
fillNA <- numeric()
for (i in 1:nrow(activity)) {
  obs <- activity[i, ]
  if (is.na(obs$steps)) {
    steps <- subset(StepsAverage, interval == obs$interval)$steps
  } else {
    steps <- obs$steps
  }
  fillNA <- c(fillNA, steps)
}
new_activity <- activity
new_activity$steps <- fillNA
StepsTotal2 <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = new_activity, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
hist(StepsTotal2$steps, main = "Total steps by day", xlab = "day", col = "red")
mean(StepsTotal2$steps)
median(StepsTotal2$steps)

day <- weekdays(activity$date)
daylevel <- vector()
for (i in 1:nrow(activity)) {
  if (day[i] == "Saturday") {
    daylevel[i] <- "Weekend"
  } else if (day[i] == "Sunday") {
    daylevel[i] <- "Weekend"
  } else {
    daylevel[i] <- "Weekday"
  }
}
activity$daylevel <- daylevel
activity$daylevel <- factor(activity$daylevel)

stepsByDay <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + daylevel, data = activity, mean)
names(stepsByDay) <- c("interval", "daylevel", "steps")
xyplot(steps ~ interval | daylevel, stepsByDay, type = "l", layout = c(1, 2), 
       xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Number of steps")


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
